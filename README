following the tutorial on Java Spring from https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/
to test, run PayrollApplication.java (F5 in VScode), then visit localhost:8080/employees
additional tutorial to try: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot

to checkout a previous git commit: git checkout <commit hash>
   puts you in a 'detached HEAD' state
   can make changes and commit them, then discard any commits by doing another checkout
       won't be able to checkout another branch without committing current changes first
       if you checkout without retaining your commits on another branch, it will be
       difficult to retrieve this commit later (possible? i think alex and stephen think it is)
   to retain those commits, create a new branch: git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
       if you've already committed, keep it w new branch: git branch <new-branch-name> <commit-hash>
